 Node CPU and memory usage. — 
For system node CPU usage, we can use linux command sar, vmstat, top and mpstat to collect
For system MEM usage, we can use top, vmstat, free.
For Cassandra heap memory usage we can use nodeool info to check the heap and off-heap mem usage

 Read and write latencies
For system node on linux we can use iostat
For Cassandra node we can use nodetool tablehistograms and nodetool tablestats. Or we can use Cassandra JMX beans

 Number of pending compactions
nodetool tpstats to see  number of pending compactions in the queue and number of completed. Also nodetool compactionstats to see the total and completed currently


Number of active connections
I used lsof -i:9042 -i:9160 | grep ESTABLISHED to list all connection on the node

df -h and 
du -h —max-depth <ks_folder> for individual folders associated to keyspace and tables
